# Algorithm Visualizer

## Introduction
Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive web application that visually demonstrates the behavior of various algorithms. The goal of the platform is to support learning and understanding algorithms in a clear and visually traceable way—whether for education, practice, or deeper professional exploration.

## Algorithm Visualization
Algorithm Visualizer allows users to observe how algorithms operate in real time through the visual representation of JavaScript-based code execution. This approach effectively supports a deeper understanding of algorithmic thinking and execution flow.

## Algorithms
The application visualizes a wide range of classical algorithms and data structures commonly used in computer science.
